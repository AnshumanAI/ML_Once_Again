Overview
Welcome to your Machine Learning Once Again Notebooks repository! Whether you're refreshing your skills or exploring new concepts, these notebooks provide a practical hands-on experience.
This is written by Chatgpt, actually I used to do ML projects prior to my postgraduate. Starting from scratch all over again.

Getting Started

Run the cells in each notebook sequentially to follow the step-by-step process.
Feel free to modify the notebooks for your specific projects and experiments.
